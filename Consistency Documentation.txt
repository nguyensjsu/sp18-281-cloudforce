Basic Consistency definition:
Consistency (C) means a strong consistency. For example, if a server receives a data change request with strong consistency, that means that all upcoming requests to any server in the cluster shall see the same change immediately after that.

But actually consistency cannot be attained in real time and what we get in return is Eventual consistency

Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.[1] Eventual consistency, also called optimistic replication,[2] is widely deployed in distributed systems, and has origins in early mobile computing projects.[3] A system that has achieved eventual consistency is often said to have converged, or achieved replica convergence.[4] Eventual consistency is a weak guarantee â€“ most stronger models, like linearizability are trivially eventually consistent, but a system that is merely eventually consistent does not usually fulfill these stronger constraints.

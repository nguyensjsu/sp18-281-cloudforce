## WEEK1

The first challenge was to come up with an idea for the SASS app, we have decided to come up with an idea individually.

And After Comparing all the ideas, we will choose the best one.

Every team member, came up with an idea, The ideas were,

Dropbox prototype,
Freelance Prototype,
Travel Application Prototype,
Restauarant Application,
Movie-ticket prototype.

After comparing all the ideas, we chose Restauarant application as the best one among them. It was simple in terms of UI, and simple to scale too.

After deciding on the sass application, we divided the microservices to include in our individual go apis.

Each team member picked their microservice and started working on it.

And Every team member will also work on the Front end code, in nodejs for their respective FrontEnd.

## WEEK2
